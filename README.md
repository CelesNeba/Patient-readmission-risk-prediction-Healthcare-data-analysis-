Patient readmission risk prediction

### Step 1 — Problem Statement

While repeat patient visits can increase revenue for the hospital, unplanned 30-day readmissions create operational strain, increased resource utilization, and potential penalties under quality regulations (e.g., CMS readmission penalties). The hospital wants to optimize patient care and resource allocation by understanding which patients are at higher risk of readmission, so it can improve care planning, reduce avoidable readmissions, and maintain compliance with quality standards.


### Key questions to answer

• What percentage of patients are readmitted within 30 days?

• How does readmission rate vary by age group?

• How does readmission rate differ between male and female patients?

• Are emergency admissions more likely to result in readmission than elective admissions?

• How does length of stay affect readmission likelihood?

• Does the number of previous admissions increase the risk of readmission?

• Which departments have the highest readmission rates?

• Does insurance type correlate with readmission patterns?

• Are there patient groups that might require more post-discharge support to reduce readmissions?

• Which combination of features best predicts 30-day readmission?

• Which combination of features best predicts 30-day readmission?
